### Andana == Narrative

[Storytelling is part of what makes us human.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/03/09/the-science-of-storytelling/#4f9a68502d8a) You participate in and tell stories daily. Sometimes they nest themselves to share something [sublime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allegory_of_the_Cave), other times they share something [highly technical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain#Gambling). In no way is the narrative less important to the latter. [Narrative is essential.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brentdykes/2016/03/31/data-storytelling-the-essential-data-science-skill-everyone-needs/#16820dbf52ad) And often, storytelling is a lost art in the data science space -- yet, narratives run decision making in our world.

This blog is dedicated to improving narrative in data science. The topics I plan to address (though certainly not limit to) are

1. Successful communication of data science findings--demystifying the technical, democratizing the hypothesis generation. Empowering the non-technical may put practicing data science clerics into 

2. Tools that assist the narrative

3. Translating the science of Causal Inference into Data Science methods
