  Storytelling is part of what makes us human. You participate in 
  and tell stories daily. Sometimes they nest themselves to share 
  something sublime, other times they share something highly technical. 
  In no way is the narrative less important to the latter. 
  Narrative is essential. And often, storytelling is a lost art in 
  the data science space â€“ yet, narratives run decision making in our 
  world.
